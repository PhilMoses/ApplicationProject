# ApplicationProject

You can add all the input CSV files you wish to evalute directly into the BackbaseApplicationProject folder as my project can evaluate multiple files

When prompted you have input the firstname, surname of the Customer and then you will prompted to enter the csv filename which you need to add the .csv
for example if I search for Book1.csv I have to enter "Book1.csv"

You will then be prompted if you want to try another file, input "Y" to keep try more files otherwise input anything other than Y to end the session

The results will be in the BackbaseApplicationProject folder in the same location as the input file. The output csv will have the name format of 
"OutPutFileOf"+filename of the input csv.

I used Bob Laramee's Coding Convention that can be found here https://cs.swan.ac.uk/~csbob/teaching/laramee10codeConventionSlides.pdf
